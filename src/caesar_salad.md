# Caesar Salad

The typical format of flags in this contest was `ctfZero{leet-speak}`. Going by the same format, we can quickly observe that the ROT cipher shift in this question was 14. Alternatively, we can also write a simple python script to brute-force ROT cipher decryption.

```py
{{#include ./includes/caesar_salad.py}}
```
