# XOR everything, shouldn't you?

The title gives you the hint that you need to xor all the values. But of what? Well, the lowercase alphabet, since that's what is mentioned in the challenge message. And obviously, the values being XOR'ed are the ASCII values of the characters we take.

Here is a simple script in python to do this, though you can do it on paper as well (:

```py
{{#include ./includes/xor_everything.py}}
```
